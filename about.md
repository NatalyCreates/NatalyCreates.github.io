Hey there! I'm Nataly Eliyahu. I make games and occasionally do other creative work.
I've worked on freelance projects in Unity3D as a programmer, and done some game design work as well.
I also participate in jams and work on my own independant projects.
In my spare time I enjoy playing board games with friends, watching disaster movies, and working on improving myself in every aspect.

Check out some of my work on this website! If you think we can work together, don't hesitate to contact me:

I'm interested in freelance projects, particularly in Unity3D or Python, though I'm diving deeper into some other technologies as well.
I'm also interested in employment opportunities in the game industry, in Canada and the US.
