Hey there! I'm Nataly Shalem. I make games and other creative stuff.
My current full time project is an indie puzzle game called [Zen Garden][].
I've worked on freelance projects in Unity3D as a programmer and as a game designer.
I participate in game jams and work on varied creative projects in my free time. I learn something new from every project.
When I'm not making games, I play board games with friends, write blog posts, watch sci-fi movies, and work to improve myself in every aspect of life.

I'm looking for a job as a programmer in the game industry. Preferably in the San Francisco Bay Area, but other locations in the US, Canada, or England are an option too.
I have experience with Python, C++, C#, Unity3D, Native Android Development, Reverse Engineering, Game Design and Creative and Technical Writing.
