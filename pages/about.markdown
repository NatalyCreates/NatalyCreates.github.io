Hey there! I'm **Nataly Bendersky Shalem**. I make games and other creative stuff.

My current full time project is an indie puzzle game called [Zen Garden][].

I've worked on games and other projects in Unity3D as a programmer and as a game designer.

I participate in many game jams and work on creative projects in my free time. I learn something new from every project.

When I'm not making games, I play board games with friends, write blog posts, watch sci-fi movies, and work to improve myself in every aspect of life.

I'm **looking for a job** as a programmer in the game industry. Preferably in the San Francisco Bay Area. Other locations in the US, Canada, or England are an option too.

#### Technology Experience
